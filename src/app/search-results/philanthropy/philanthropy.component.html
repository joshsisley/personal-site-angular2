			<p class="result-info">I worked as a kids church leader and mentor for K-2nd on Sundays and Wednesdays every month. -- This was one of the most rewarding things that I had the opportunity to do because I had the opportunity to be a mentor for kids who came from broken homes. -- I was able to give them some stability in their lives by being there every week to teach and interact with them.</p>
